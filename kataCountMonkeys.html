    <h1>Kata: Count the Monkeys</h1>
    <h2>Open the console</h2>
    <p>
      You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys.<br />
      You know that there are a certain number there (n),<br />
      but your son is too young to just appreciate the <br />
      full number, he has to start counting them from 1.<br />
      <br />
      As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. <br />
      Given the number (n), populate an array with all <br />
      numbers up to and including that number, but excluding<br />
      zero.<br />
      <br />
      For example:<br />
      <br />
      monkeyCount(10) // --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]<br />
      monkeyCount(1) // --> [1]<br />
    </p>
